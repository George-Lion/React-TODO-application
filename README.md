## React TODO application

The following project generates a list of tasks with options that allow you to add or delete it. Each component is divided into a file and through the
using `props` we can access them from our home.

The rendering shows us the title and then a `form` label in which the `input` is found in which the user will enter his task and insert it in the list by means of a button, in the body the added tasks will appear and in the part lower the count of the number of tasks.
